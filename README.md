# time_management_hourly_wage
You know, it's hard to combine job and studying at university. And to do so i prefer hourly wage job - i am the only one who decides how much i work today.
I would say much warm words about hourly wage job, but the most important thing that you need to calculate approximately how much you work today basing on your schedule and when you need to leave if you want to work some hours this day.

It's my pet project where i try different easy things that warm my heart and don't destroy my overheated brain.
